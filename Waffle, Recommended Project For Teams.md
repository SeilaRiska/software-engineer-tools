##__Waffle, Recommended Project For Teams__

###__What is Waffle?__

Waffle is a project management tool powered by your GitHub Issues and Pull Requests. Interact with your Issues and Pull Requests from one or more repositories in the form of cards on a board. Plan, organize, and track work together as a team in a view that works for everyone. This is the Waffle team's Issues Only repository for public facing feature work, enhancements, and issues. Waffle users can add issues through GitHub Issues or directly on our Waffle board. It's best to search our board before adding new Issues in an effort to reduce duplicates and encourage activity on existing conversations.

Among the many advantages we encountered in this process we can cite:

__1. Easy to use__, Task management can now be done through GitHub, preferred by the technical team, or Waffle, loved by product teams. Or even through the command line, using a few scripts the technical team created. In addition, since we have GitHub integrated with Slack, we can also monitor the project directly through the chat. Also, I personally use an iPhone app to observe the activities while Iâ€™m out of the office.

__2. Better connection between tasks and code__, We were using Jiraâ€™s integration with GitHub to facilitate the matching of tasks with its respective code, but having it all under the same repository made it even easier to manage.

__3. Lower cost. Since we were only using a few of Jiraâ€™s many functionalities__, its cost was not really justifiable. On the other hand, Waffleâ€™s free plan is great and sufficient for our needs. We can now reallocate the investment we had on Jira to other tools.

__4. Statistics__, One of Jiraâ€™s greatest features is definitely the wide range of graphs and statistics it provides. However, since we had the code on GitHub some information would get lost and not be considered on performance and estimate statistics. Waffle does provide a simple graph showing the number of issues and pull requests done by week, which is useful but not sufficient. For advanced statistics and information on the project we are now using Planrockr. It provides useful monitoring tools and insights on increasing the projectâ€™s performance.

__5. Easy Set Up__, Sick of project management tools with unreliable GitHub Integrations? Waffle is built on top of the GitHub API, so your work and its status will always be in sync. Just sign in to Waffle using GitHub -- within 5 minutes, you can transform your long lists of GitHub Issues and Pull Requests into a big picture view of what's planned, what's being worked on, and what's up next. 

__6. Pick your favorite view__, Cards on a Board in Waffle or Issues in GitHub. When you create a project in Waffle, your Issues and Pull Requests transform into cards on a board. This friendly board view, similar to Trello, is built with everyone on your team in mind. Team members can do work in Waffle or GitHub. Use the view that makes the most sense for the work you're doing. 

__7. Maintain a single source of truth in your workflow__, Add, update, comment on, and close cards in GitHub, or in Waffle. View all updates in real time, regardless of where you do your work. Always know what's planned, in progress, waiting for review, and ready to ship.

__8. Track the work you're already doing with ease__, Track your work as you work. Updating your status from GitHub is simple-- just add a label to the issue. Use cues in commits or pull requests to move cards across the board automatically. Move work in progress with the push of a branch. For team members who prefer Waffleâ€™s board view, updating status is as easy as dragging and dropping cards across the board.

__9. Work together like the team that you are__, Eliminate extra tools, silos, and meetings. Invite everyone (QA, design, marketing, etc) to participate. Create repos for their work, too (Issues Only repos, like this one, are great for non-dev roles.) Organize your work on one board, with many repos representing your collective work, together, as a team.

###__Tools for Open Source__

1.	Badges

	Newly "Waffled" public repositories are prompted with a banner asking to add a badge to your repository's README. If you agree to it, we'll instantly issue a pull request to your repository with the default badge snippet. Badges are also customizable and accessible at any time from your Project Settings. Collaborators, contributors, and community members can click on the badge to view your Waffle board, giving them a quick, big picture view of what's in progress and how they can help.

2.	Graphs

	Waffle also offers the option to embed a throughput graph to your README. The graph shows how many Issues and Pull Requests are closed weekly, allowing others to view the activity level of your open source project.

3.	Features
	
	- Account lookup locally and in Active Directory via Win32 API with zero configuration. 
	- Enumerating Active Directory domains and domain information. 
	- Returns computer domain / workgroup join information. 
	- Supports logon for local and domain users returning consistent fully qualified names, identity (SIDs), local and domain groups, including nested. 
	- Supports all functions required for implementing server-side single-signon with Negotiate and NTLM and various implementations for Java web servers. 
	- Supports Windows Identity impersonation. 
	- Includes a Windows Installer Merge Module for distribution of C# binaries. 

>The migration from Jira to GitHub + Waffle made life easier, in distinctive ways, for everyone in the team. By using GitHubâ€™s native integration we reduced the number of conventions that developers need to follow to maintain the tasks synchronized with the code. Moreover, with Waffle and Planrockr we manage to keep the entire team informed about the projectâ€™s overall progress. This migration also opened our horizons to create a new set of automations that will make the teamâ€™s day-to-day activities simpler and more enjoyable.
